- Web Design & Coding student
- Currently preparing for a Cybersecurity Master’s degree in Ireland

### Current Focus

- Cloud security fundamentals (AWS)

### Goal
To build a strong defensive security profile and pursue SOC Analyst roles in Europe, starting with Ireland and later Switzerland.

This GitHub documents my hands-on labs, learning notes, and practical security analysis as I progress in my cybersecurity journey.
